`Simple and easy to use app for BIT students.`

This app contains the Bit Lalpur syllabus for `UG` and `PG` programs. It also has an integrated ERP
cell, so you won't have to go to your browsers. It also includes many other tools, such as an
attendance manager and a CGPA calculator, to assist you in keeping track of your attendance and
avoiding f stars. For your convenience, the notice section contains notices based on Bit Mesra's
website and the holiday list. We've also included a society section in the app so you can connect
with them and participate
in their events.
